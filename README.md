The goal of latticeMap is to â€¦

## Installation

You can install the released version of latticeMap from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("latticeMap")
# covr::package_coverage()
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(latticeMap)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'latticeMap'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:datasets':
#> 
#>     volcano
## basic example code
```

## Visualization

  - `draw.colorkey`: modified from lattice, add triangle head and tail
